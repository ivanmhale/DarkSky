#DarkSky Weather App

## This web application uses the DarkSky api. Ran locally, the front-end proxies get requests to the server running on a seperate port. This was originally a front-end only application, but since a proxy directly to 'https://api.darksky.net' doesn't work when viewed on GitHub pages, I needed to add an Express backend to make calls to the api when in a production environment.
